=== Simple Chroma-Key ===



= Green/Blue Screen Cutoff Shader

1. Apply the shader to the material you want to apply the chroma key effect to.
2. Tweak the cutoff value to get the desired effect.



= Custom Color Cutoff Shader

1. Apply the shader to the material you want to apply the chroma key effect to.
2. Set the color you want to "cut out".
3. Tweak the cutoff value and smoothing to get the desired effect.



Notes:

- All shaders should work when applied to any model.
- All shaders should work with video and webcam feeds.
- All shaders are very fast and effecient so shouldn't impact performance.
- Custom color shader has a smoothing applied to it, so should give a better effect.
- The green/blue screen shaders are slightly quicker than the custom color shader,
use these if performance is super important (such as mobile).
